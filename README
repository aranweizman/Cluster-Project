This project is a simple collection of converters, that are used in sequence to get the plotted route
of a bus line.

all the data that is required by the all_routes_data directory(and is too heavy to push to git)
(from israel-public-transportation zip file - which is taken from https://gtfs.mot.gov.il/gtfsfiles/):
    - trips.csv
    - shapes.csv

desired_lines_info:
The ClusterToLine.csv file was taken from https://gtfs.mot.gov.il/gtfsfiles/
this file lists all lines pertaining to a cluster (a zone in the country(Israel)), for all such clusters.

the extractor(extractor.py) is set to extract all routes that are local to Modi'in,
and thus produces the 'filtered_routes.csv'(which is already produced)

line_to_trip.py:
the line_to_trip.py module is meant to convert the OfficeLineID number to the trip_id number,
from which the trip stops and shape can be filtered (from the files in all_routes_data)
for now a prefix is missing from the OfficeLineID (which was completed manually for the sake of example).

notes:
the route plotted belongs to line number 89.
